What is a Software Architect?

I don't know. I have Software Architecture responsibilities, but I don't know what is a Software Architect.

What is the difference between Software Architecture and Software Design? Is the design of a component Architecture or is it ... design? Maybe...it is the same thing but at different levels.


What is the difference between a Software Architect and a Tech Lead or a Senior Software Developer for that matter? Where do we draw a line, especially in today's Agile World where everybody is expected to get involved, and the lines between responsibilities get more and more blurry.

Join me in this journey that is meant to aid, at the very least, me, to get a better understanding of Software Architecture.
